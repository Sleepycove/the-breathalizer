Very, very, very N.S.F.W.

(A tribute to the great man himself, built with his knowledge and tacit approval)

## Install

`npm install` should get the gulp file up-and-running. (you *do* know all about [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), don't you?)

---

## File explanation

### SASS/CSS
All the SASS action takes place in `sass/_theGoodStuff.scss` with the exception of colour and type variables, which live in `sass/_declarations.scss`

### JS
All the functionality lives in `js/raw/main.js`

Extra feature- and pull-requests are very welcome.

Enjoy!

P.S. 2-space indentation F.T.W.!
